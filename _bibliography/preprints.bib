 abstract = {Recent work on game-theoretic statistics and safe anytime-valid inference (SAVI) provides new tools for statistical inference without assuming any regularity conditions. In particular, the framework of universal inference proposed by Wasserman, Ramdas, and Balakrishnan (2020) offers new solutions by modifying the likelihood ratio test in a data-splitting scheme (split likelihood ratio test). In this paper, we study the performance of the split likelihood ratio test under normal mixture models, which are canonical examples of models in which classical regularity conditions fail to hold. We first establish that under the null hypothesis, the split likelihood ratio test statistic is asymptotically normal with increasing mean and variance. Moreover, contradicting the usual belief that the flexibility of SAVI and universal methods comes at the price of a loss of power, we are able to prove that universal inference surprisingly achieves the same detection rate $(n^{−1} \log \log n)^{1/2}$ as the classical likelihood ratio test.

 abstract = {Due to the lack of a canonical ordering in ℝd for d>1, defining multivariate generalizations of the classical univariate ranks has been a long-standing open problem in statistics. Optimal transport has been shown to offer a solution in which multivariate ranks are obtained by transporting data points to a grid that approximates a uniform reference measure (Chernozhukov et al., 2017; Hallin, 2017; Hallin et al., 2021), thereby inducing ranks, signs, and a data-driven ordering of ℝd. We take up this new perspective to define and study multivariate analogues of the sign covariance/quadrant statistic, Spearman's rho, Kendall's tau, and van der Waerden covariances. The resulting tests of multivariate independence are fully distribution-free, hence uniformly valid irrespective of the actual (absolutely continuous) distribution of the observations. Our results provide the asymptotic distribution theory for these new test statistics, with asymptotic approximations to critical values to be used for testing independence between random vectors, as well as a power analysis of the resulting tests in an extension of the so-called Konijn model. For the van der Waerden tests, this power analysis includes a multivariate Chernoff--Savage property guaranteeing that, under elliptical generalized Konijn models, the asymptotic relative efficiency with respect to Wilks' classical (pseudo-)Gaussian procedure of our van der Waerden tests is strictly larger than or equal to one, where equality is achieved under Gaussian distributions only. We similarly provide a lower bound for the asymptotic relative efficiency of our Spearman procedure with respect to Wilks' test, thus extending the classical result by Hodges and Lehmann on the asymptotic relative efficiency, in univariate location models, of Wilcoxon tests with respect to the Student ones.},
