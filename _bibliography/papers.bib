  abstract = {In recent work, Azadkia and Chatterjee (2021) laid out an ingenious approach to defining consistent measures of conditional dependence. Their fully nonparametric approach forms statistics based on ranks and nearest neighbor graphs. The appealing nonparametric consistency of the resulting conditional dependence measure and the associated empirical conditional dependence coefficient has quickly prompted follow-up work that seeks to study its statistical efficiency. In this paper, we take up the framework of conditional randomization tests (CRT) for conditional independence and conduct a power analysis that considers two types of local alternatives, namely, parametric quadratic mean differentiable alternatives and nonparametric Hölder smooth alternatives. Our local power analysis shows that conditional independence tests using the Azadkia–Chatterjee coefficient remain inefficient even when aided with the CRT framework, and serves as motivation to develop variants of the approach; cf. Lin and Han (2022+). As a byproduct, we resolve a conjecture of Azadkia and Chatterjee by proving central limit theorems for the considered conditional dependence coefficients, with explicit formulas for the asymptotic variances.},

  abstract = {Chatterjee (2021) introduced a simple new rank correlation coefficient that has attracted much attention recently. The coefficient has the unusual appeal that it not only estimates a population quantity first proposed by Dette et al. (2013) that is zero if and only if the underlying pair of random variables is independent, but also is asymptotically normal under independence. This paper compares Chatterjee’s new correlation coefficient with three established rank correlations that also facilitate consistent tests of independence, namely Hoeffding’s D⁠, Blum–Kiefer–Rosenblatt’s R⁠, and Bergsma–Dassios–Yanagimoto’s τ∗⁠. We compare the computational efficiency of these rank correlation coefficients in light of recent advances, and investigate their power against local rotation and mixture alternatives. Our main results show that Chatterjee’s coefficient is unfortunately rate-suboptimal compared to D⁠, R and τ∗⁠. The situation is more subtle for a related earlier estimator of Dette et al. (2013). These results favour D⁠, R and τ∗ over Chatterjee’s new correlation coefficient for the purpose of testing independence.},

  abstract = {Rank correlations have found many innovative applications in the last decade. In particular, suitable rank correlations have been used for consistent tests of independence between pairs of random variables. Using ranks is especially appealing for continuous data as tests become distribution-free. However, the traditional concept of ranks relies on ordering data and is, thus, tied to univariate observations. As a result, it has long remained unclear how one may construct distribution-free yet consistent tests of independence between random vectors. This is the problem addressed in this paper, in which we lay out a general framework for designing dependence measures that give tests of multivariate independence that are not only consistent and distribution-free but which we also prove to be statistically efficient. Our framework leverages the recently introduced concept of center-outward ranks and signs, a multivariate generalization of traditional ranks, and adopts a common standard form for dependence measures that encompasses many popular examples. In a unified study, we derive a general asymptotic representation of center-outward rank-based test statistics under independence, extending to the multivariate setting the classical Hájek asymptotic representation results. This representation permits direct calculation of limiting null distributions and facilitates a local power analysis that provides strong support for the center-outward approach by establishing, for the first time, the nontrivial power of center-outward rank-based tests over root-n neighborhoods within the class of quadratic mean differentiable alternatives.},

  abstract = {This article investigates the problem of testing independence of two random vectors of general dimensions. For this, we give for the first time a distribution-free consistent test. Our approach combines distance covariance with the center-outward ranks and signs developed by Marc Hallin and collaborators. In technical terms, the proposed test is consistent and distribution-free in the family of multivariate distributions with nonvanishing (Lebesgue) probability densities. Exploiting the (degenerate) U-statistic structure of the distance covariance and the combinatorial nature of Hallin’s center-outward ranks and signs, we are able to derive the limiting null distribution of our test statistic. The resulting asymptotic approximation is accurate already for moderate sample sizes and makes the test implementable without requiring permutation. The limiting distribution is derived via a more general result that gives a new type of combinatorial noncentral limit theorem for double- and multiple-indexed permutation statistics.

  abstract = {Testing mutual independence for high-dimensional observations is a fundamental statistical challenge. Popular tests based on linear and simple rank correlations are known to be incapable of detecting nonlinear, nonmonotone relationships, calling for methods that can account for such dependences. To address this challenge, we propose a family of tests that are constructed using maxima of pairwise rank correlations that permit consistent assessment of pairwise independence. Built upon a newly developed Cramér-type moderate deviation theorem for degenerate U-statistics, our results cover a variety of rank correlations including Hoeffding’s D, Blum–Kiefer–Rosenblatt’s R and Bergsma–Dassios–Yanagimoto’s τ∗. The proposed tests are distribution-free in the class of multivariate distributions with continuous margins, implementable without the need for permutation, and are shown to be rate-optimal against sparse alternatives under the Gaussian copula model. As a by-product of the study, we reveal an identity between the aforementioned three rank correlation statistics, and hence make a step towards proving a conjecture of Bergsma and Dassios.},
