I am currently a <a href='https://www.math.cit.tum.de/en/statistics/people/hongjian-shi/'>Postdoc</a> at the <a href='https://www.math.cit.tum.de/en/statistics/home/'>Research group Mathematical Statistics</a>, the <a href='https://www.tum.de/en/'>Technical University of Munich</a> under the direction of <a href='https://www.math.cit.tum.de/en/statistics/people/mathias-drton/'>Mathias Drton</a>. Prior to this, I obtained my Ph.D. in <a href='https://stat.uw.edu/'>Statistics</a> in 2021 at the <a href='https://www.washington.edu/'>University of Washington</a>, where I was advised by <a href='https://sites.stat.washington.edu/people/fanghan/'>Fang Han</a>.

The research projects I have finished so far are concerned with a fundamental problem in statistics, namely, how to properly measure stochastic dependence between random quantities. My research pays much attention to statistical inference that is based on ranking data points and analyzing the ranks rather than the original data.

My current and future research plans, building on the expertise I have developed, will focus on high-dimensional and nonparametric methods, from theoretical as well as methodological perspectives. I will continue to explore the problem of testing independence, with the goal of being able to address high-dimensional vector independence and to offer new tests of conditional independence. Moreover, I will turn to new areas in statistical inference. Specifically, I will seek to exploit in new ways the center-outward multivariate ranks based on optimal transport, and I will study newly developed frameworks such as universal inference, as I detail below.
